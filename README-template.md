## My process
  First I built the whole HTML part, then I went to the css, I started by aligning the elements vertically and horizontally, then I put a border, colors, sizes and then I finished.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .Container {
    max-width: 360px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding-bottom: 50px;
    position: relative;
}

.Card {
    position: relative;
    top: 120px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    padding: 22px;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development
  Position and padding.
